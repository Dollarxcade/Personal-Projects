Some of my side projects
### Weather Bot
> [!NOTE]
> This project is incomplete.

This was a weather bot that I made for Discord because I couldn't find a bot that could tell me the weather and I wanted to know that in Discord for some reason. Now it isn't fully functional it doesn't really do anything other than being able to play ping pong with it so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, therefore it isn't really a weather bot. I don't remember when I did this I forgot to write the date so I will update it the next time I decide to go back to it. Eventually, I would find a Discord bot that would do this, first ZeroTwo and now YAGPDG. So I don't plan on coming back to this ever.
### Silvaria Draft System
> [!CAUTION]
> This script *can* break Google Sheets. Use at your own discretion.

So basically I have a Google Sheets file that is a simulation of a Valorant round-robin league with a large database and advanced simulation calculations and so to make the teams using the player's database I tried using a snake draft system and to do that an easy way was to code an app script using JavaScript using my JavaScript background. Still, it would prove to be tougher than I thought as sheets has a lot of quirks that I couldn't understand, so I successfully coded a draft but it would only simulate the first round and it would also create tens of thousands of rows by itself (I don't know how it did that) and so it doesn't work. It also breaks Google Sheets so I decided to do it the hard way and use functions within Google Sheets and so it's currently a work-in-progress as of the last update.
